定冠詞と不定冠詞の用法は分かっている（つもり）だけれど、無冠詞がさっぱりなので下記ページの例文を引用してまとめた。少なくとも抽象化の機能は分かるけれど、その他例外が多すぎて、考え方を身に付けるよりもパターンを覚えた方が早いと思った次第。

+ ## The Definite Article

> The definite article is the word the. It limits the meaning of a noun to one particular thing.

+ ## The Indefinite Article

> Indefinite articles are used when we are referring to an unspecified thing or quantity. We use them when we don’t know (or don’t care) which thing we’re talking about.
