## 冠詞おさらい: Definite, Indefinite and Zero Articles

> The definite article is the word the. It limits the meaning of a noun to one particular thing[^1].

> The indefinite article indicates that a noun refers to a general idea rather than a particular thing[^1]. 

> Occasionally, articles are omitted altogether before certain nouns. In these cases, the article is implied but not actually present. This implied article is sometimes called a “zero article.”[^1]
