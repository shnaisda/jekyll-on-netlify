> The definite article is the word the. It limits the meaning of a noun to one particular thing[^1].

> The indefinite article indicates that a noun refers to a general idea rather than a particular thing[^1]. 

> Occasionally, articles are omitted altogether before certain nouns. In these cases, the article is implied but not actually present. This implied article is sometimes called a “zero article.”[^1]

* Typically, the article the is not used before the names of countries and territories:

 Our flight to China was canceled.

+   However, the is used before countries whose
    + names are plural in form:
    
        + Have you ever been to the Netherlands?

    + names include the words states, kingdom, or republic:

My sister lives in the United States.
