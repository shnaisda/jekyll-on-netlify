> The definite article is the word the. It limits the meaning of a noun to one particular thing[^1].

例えば、“Are you going to the party this weekend?”。これは定冠詞theがあることで、お互いに知っている「あのパーティ」について言っていると分かる。

> The indefinite article indicates that a noun refers to a general idea rather than a 
particular thing[^1]. 

例えば、“Should I bring a gift to the party?” 。これは不定冠詞aがあることで、一般的なギフトについて言っていると分かる。

> Occasionally, articles are omitted altogether before certain nouns. In these cases, the article is implied but not actually present. This implied article is sometimes called a “zero article.”[^1]

+ Sports and academic subjects do not require articles:
    + {:.eg} I like to play baseball.
    + My sister was always good at math.
+ The article the is not used before the names of countries and territories:
    + Our flight to China was canceled.
+ However, the is used before countries whose
    + names are plural in form:
        + Have you ever been to the Netherlands?
    + names include the words states, kingdom, or republic:
        + My sister lives in the United States.
